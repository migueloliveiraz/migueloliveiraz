<p>I'm a junior back-end developer, physics enthusiast, I like challenges and I'm constantly learning. I am currently studying about TDD, SOLID, AWS & Architecture. I'm focused on improving my knowledge in NodeJS and Typescript.</p>
<p>I've been studying programming since I was 12 years old, and since then I've been training myself to have a strong foundation. </p>
